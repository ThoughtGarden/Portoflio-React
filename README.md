# React1 Example Project

This project is a simple example of React code, created to demonstrate my ability to build React applications. It features a movie search and display interface, allowing users to view popular movies and search for specific titles. The project uses React with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement.

## Features

- Search for movies by title
- View a grid of popular movies
- Responsive and minimal UI
- Example of React hooks and component structure

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Purpose

This repository serves as a showcase of my React coding skills and can be used as a reference or starting point for building React applications.
